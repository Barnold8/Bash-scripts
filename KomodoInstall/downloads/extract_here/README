Patched the source files to let you customise KMD.

KMD has an option for specifying a GTK+ theme, but it still
forces some UI elements to use the default colours. With this
patch, you get full control over KMD-s colours.

I also removed that weird icon from the top right corner, and
made the green arrow in the program view a flat green colour.

All changes are marked by a comment containing 'DARK_THEME_PATCH:'
If you wanted to make further changes, or to revert some of them,
then start by searching for these comments.

To use the theme, launch KMD with the command:
kmd -t PATH/TO/kmd_dark.gtkrc [OPTIONS]

Feel free to make changes to the .gtkrc file
