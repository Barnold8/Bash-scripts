# Komodo installer

# About:

    This is a bash script that compiles the komodo ARM emulator. I set myself to do this so I can easily program ARM assembly for my uni course. If you want to use this, you will need:

        * Ubuntu
        * GCC
    
    Sorry windows users, you would have to go through a whole lot of work to get this to work and compile on your systems. However, other distro users, you may be able to substitute your super user commands where ubuntu's is and get it working.

    The backups folder contains files that you need for this compilation to succeed since the libraries contain code that just outright doesnt work

# How to:

    > To install:

        run Komodo.sh and wait for around **2m 38s** (this is what it took for me to compile)

    > To run:

        Go to the Komodo src directory KMD-1.5.0/src and run ./kmd -e and the software should launch! Congrats! Happy programming!
